            <p className="fs-5">My name's Alireza Javadzadeh M. Following my graduation from NODET, I began building up my career based on my interests, including Programming and linguistics. I have faced loads of IT-related challenges when I was a student. Now it's the time to develop my career using the things I learned in the past few years. I'm currently working as English tutor in KISH Institute of Science and Technology.</p>
